# Perception


An Augmented Reality (AR) mobile application that allows users to visualize and place virtual furniture in real-world environments using their smartphone camera. Built using ***Kotlin*** and ***ARCore***, this app is designed to help users make smarter interior design decisions by experiencing how furniture fits and looks in their space — before buying.
